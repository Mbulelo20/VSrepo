What Is Agile?

Agile is a methodology that is used in managing large projects, such as software development. Agile involves designers, and developers, and business in breaking down the large project into iterations; iterations are small manageable chunks.

Agile is dependent on the customer’s requirements, the final product, the ability to react to change after a plan and on the interactions of the individuals involved.

These are some of the characteristics of Agile:

°Modularity
°Iterative
°Time boxing
°Parsimony
°Incremental 

Some of the advantages of  agile:

° Agile is flexible: changes can be introduced during a later stage of development
° It has sprints: set periods of time in which work has to be done and reviewed
°  Small amounts of work are affected when clients add or remove some of requirements

SCRUM

In a  scrum, a backlog is set and continuously updated. Sprint, sprint planning, daily scrum (15 min team meeting), sprint review and sprint retrospective are all entailed in a scrum.
